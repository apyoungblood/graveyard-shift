## Game Phases:
There are two main phases:
1) Set traps and prepare for invading robbers
2) A wave of invaders approaches and you must defend the graves' treasures

In between a cycle of each two phases you'll get a score based on how many waves you've survived multiplied by treasures that are left.

The game ends once all the treasures are stolen.
